;; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life

;; The universe of the Game of Life is an infinite two-dimensional orthogonal
;; grid of square cells, each of which is in one of two possible states, alive or dead.
;; Every cell interacts with its eight neighbours,
;; which are the cells that are horizontally, vertically,
;; or diagonally adjacent.
;; At each step in time, the following transitions occur:

;; Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if caused by under-population.
;; Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
;; Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overcrowding.
;; Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.
